## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A Coinbase Developer Platform account
- **No external AI API keys required** (uses local AI)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-insights.git
cd crypto-insights
Step 2: Install Dependencies
bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Generate CDP API Keys
Go to the CDP Portal: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects

Create a new project (or select an existing one)

Navigate to API Keys in the left sidebar

Click "Create API Key"

Configure your key:

Name: crypto-insights (or your preferred name)

IP Allowlist: Add 0.0.0.0/0 for testing (restrict to your IP in production)

Permissions: Check "View (read-only)" and "Trade"

Signature Algorithm: Ed25519 (recommended)

Click "Create"

Download the JSON file - save it as cdp_api_key.json in your project folder

Step 4: Generate Wallet Secret
In the CDP Portal, go to "Server Wallet" in the left sidebar

Click "Generate" in the Wallet Secret section

Copy the secret and save it somewhere secure (you won't be able to see it again!)

Step 5: Create Configuration Files
Create .env file
Create a file named .env in your project root with the following content:

env
CDP_WALLET_SECRET=your-wallet-secret-here
Replace your-wallet-secret-here with the wallet secret you generated in Step 4.

Your cdp_api_key.json file should look like this:
json
{
   "id": "organizations/xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/apiKeys/yyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy",
   "privateKey": "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nMHcCAQEEI...\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----"
}
This file was downloaded in Step 3.

bash
python main_simple.py
First run will:

Security Best Practices
Never commit secrets - Always add .env and cdp_api_key.json to .gitignore

Use IP allowlists - Restrict API access to your specific IP addresses

Start with small amounts - Test with minimal funds before scaling up

Use read-only keys first - Test your code with view-only permissions

Rotate keys regularly - Generate new API keys periodically

Store secrets securely - Use environment variables or secret managers in production

Troubleshooting
Error: "Wallet Secret not configured"
Make sure your .env file contains CDP_WALLET_SECRET

Verify the .env file is in the same directory as your script

Check that you've generated the Wallet Secret from the CDP Portal

Error: "401 Unauthorized"
Verify your IP is in the allowlist (or use 0.0.0.0/0 for testing)

Check that your cdp_api_key.json is in the correct location

Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions enabled

Wait 2-3 minutes after adding your IP to the allowlist

Error: "python-dotenv could not parse statement"
Check your .env file for syntax errors

Make sure there are no extra quotes around values

Ensure the format is: KEY=value (no spaces around =)
