# crypto-insight (Starter MVP)

A minimal ML-powered crypto insights demo using Streamlit.

Features:
- Fetches historical price data from CoinGecko.
- Computes simple technical indicators (RSI, SMA).
- Trains a RandomForest classifier to predict next-step up/down.
- Shows model accuracy, price chart, and BUY/HOLD/SELL signal.

This is a starter: fast to run locally and easy to extend (sentiment, LSTM, RAG, React frontend).
